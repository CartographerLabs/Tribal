Given the following block of social media content, your task is to define the (most apparent) role of each user based on the following categories/definitions.
 
If a user is identified as performing behaviour that falls into multiple roles, then, in order, the following roles take priority:
People Leader: Directs, recruits and mobilises block members either virtually or in the real world.
Leader Influencer: Directs the conversation as a knowledge source and/or gatekeeper, with other members reflecting their attitudes.
Engager Negator: Negative or berating interactions in an attempt to reduce discussion or offer a counter argument against a fundamental principle groups agreement.
Engager Supporter: Positively interacts with the topic, encouraging or promoting future further discussion and ideological success.
Engager Neutral: Neutral topic interaction to learn or socially interact with members.
Bystander: Does not engage with the main discussion but remains within the discussion block.
NATTC: The user is at the beginning or end of a block (outside of the time boxed discussion) discussing a topic that the content is not engaged with.

Extremism is the promotion or advancement of an ideology based on violence, hatred or intolerance, that aims to:
1.  negate or destroy the fundamental rights and freedoms of others; or
2.  undermine, overturn or replace the UKâ€™s system of liberal parliamentary democracy and democratic rights; or
